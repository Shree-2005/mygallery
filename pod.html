<h2 color="blue">Brief Description</h2>
<p>
While the theme of varied skin tones connected with class, historicity and desire is dominant in this painting, other forms of contrast are also set in motion in its opposing values of shade and shadows, the same sun from which Ravan and his wife Mandodari seek shelter. The aggressive posture of the exulting Indrajit throws into relief the figure of his uncle, the righteous and intellectual Vibhishana who has turned away unable to bear the humiliation of Sachi, who is helpless because her husband, Indra has been defeated amd she taken a prisoner. Sachi, the queen of heavens, has an alabaster skin which contrasts with the slave holding her reinforcing the light and dark theme again. It is also seen in Mandodari and the maid behind her.<br></br><br></br>
